# 100 Days of Python 

Welcome to my journey through the **100 Days of Code: Python** course!  
I'm learning Python by building a project every day — and this repository tracks my progress.

# Daily Projects

Below are the projects I've completed so far:

- **Day 01:** Band Name Generator  
- **Day 02:** Tip Calculator  
- **Day 03:** Treasure Island Game  
- **Day 04:** Rock Paper Scissors  
- **Day 05:** Password Generator  

> I will update this list daily as I complete each new project.
